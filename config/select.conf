# The tectonic_regions section should include sub-sections for all of the
# regions that can be reported by STREC. Each subsection (except for 
# 'subduction' should have the following elements:
#   horizontal_buffer - a buffer that extends into neighboring regions
#       across which the GMPEs are blended.
#   gmpe - A list of one or more GMPE sets found in gmpe_sets.conf.
#   min_depth - A list of one or more minimum depths corresponding to
#       the GMPEs listed under 'gmpe'.
#   max_depth - A list of one or more maximum depths corresponding to
#       the GMPEs listed under 'gmpe'.
#   vertical_buffer - if the GMPE selection is depth dependent, (i.e., 
#       ther is more than one GMPE set configured under 'gmpe') this
#       buffer determines the width of the zone over which one GMPE set
#       is blended into the next.
#
# Min/max depth ranges should span all possible event depths. -Inf and Inf
# may be used for negative and positive infinity, respectively.
#
# Subduction regions should be configured with three sub-sections: crustal,
# interface, and intraslab, each of which defines a 'gmpe' parameter with
# a GMPE set.
